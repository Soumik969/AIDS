This project aims on understanding and predicting quantum mechanical properties, such as energy levels and wavefunctions, is crucial in physics and engineering. Analytical solutions to the Schr√∂dinger equation exist for only a few idealized systems, while numerical methods solves this problem but it can be computationally expensive and challenging to scale for complex systems.
